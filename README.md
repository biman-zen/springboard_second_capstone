This machine learning project tackles the challenge of predicting used car prices. The original dataset was scraped from Craigslist and Carvana in 2021, available from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data). A significant portion of this work focuses on tidying the scraped raw data for modeling. The dataset includes 426,000 rows of values and 26 different columns. Many of the records are missing and require filling in using different methods. The final dataset included just the top 60 used car models. With the cleaning dataset, four different machine learning algorithms: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest Regression were used in conjunction with 5-fold cross-validation to determine model performance. GridSearchCV was used to perform hyperparameter tuning of RF and KNN models to use the optimum paraemters. The top-performing model achieved a cross-validated MAPE of 0.48. For a detailed discussion of the analysis and results, please refer to the "CapstoneII_FinalReport_CLUsedCarDataset.pdf" report.
